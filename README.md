# GENE-TOPOLOGY
COLLEGE PROJECT BASED ON GENE TOPOLOGY
This document outline the requirement for the development of a software 
program to automate the process of finding folding points and selecting them 
to obtain the shortest possible genetic sequence using genetically optimized 
organic folding (GOOF) as requested by the International cell processing 
company (ICPC) 
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to provide a 
comprehensive overview of the requirements and specifications for developing 
a C-based program to solve the gene folding problem. This document aims to 
define the goals, functionalities, and constraints of the software system.
